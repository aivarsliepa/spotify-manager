# TODO

- rework data flow in SongLabels.tsx
- refactor spotify service (create a floder and split code and see what can be extracted for reuse)
- comply better with REST - use better methods and better return codes
- https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/streaming-updates
- get rid of mongoose ?

# Doing

- checkboxes with action menu
- creating popper for labels (songs list for now)
- got an idea, to have consistant layout like gmail between pages, even on song details page.
  and have labels be changed via that same menu (instead of like now)? Or have it different only for that song details page..
- might have different background color, when list item is checked? (like gmail)
